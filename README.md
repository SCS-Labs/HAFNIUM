- [CheckMyOWA](https://checkmyowa.unit221b.com)
> **What is it?** We set up this site to aid victim notification based on lists of compromised Exchange servers with Outlook Web Access(OWA) enabled, which were obtained from perpetrators of this mass breach event. This includes affected IPs/domains, as well as whether the actors in this first wave of attacks successfully loaded a shell. The problem of notifying such a large number of victims is compounded by the lack of legal framework or even available WHOIS data to determine the identity of the owner of an IP or domain to notify them of a serious problem on their property. This website stands as an imperfect approach to a global problem.
